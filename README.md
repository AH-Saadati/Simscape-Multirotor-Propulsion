\# Simscape-Based Dynamic Propulsion Model for Multirotors



\## üöÄ Overview



This project provides a \*\*dynamic simulation model\*\* of an electric propulsion system for \*\*multirotor aerial vehicles\*\*, built using \*\*MATLAB Simulink\*\* and \*\*Simscape\*\*.  

It integrates:



\- A sensor-based \*\*Electronic Speed Controller (ESC)\*\* with trapezoidal commutation.

\- A \*\*Brushless DC (BLDC) motor\*\* with electrical-to-mechanical energy conversion.

\- An \*\*aerodynamic propeller\*\* with modeled thrust and torque behavior.

\- A \*\*battery system\*\* with realistic state-of-charge (SOC) and voltage dynamics.



The model captures the interaction between electrical and mechanical subsystems, enabling realistic simulation of performance, efficiency, and control strategies under varying conditions.



This simulation is designed for:

\- Multirotor propulsion system design and testing.

\- Controller development and ESC logic validation.

\- Battery performance and endurance studies.

\- Research and educational purposes.
